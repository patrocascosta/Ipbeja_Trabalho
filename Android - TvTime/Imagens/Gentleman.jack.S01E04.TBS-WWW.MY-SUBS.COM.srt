00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,404
Would you like to come for dinner?

2
00:00:01,428 --> 00:00:03,976
And then... stay all night?

3
00:00:06,595 --> 00:00:09,517
Miss Lister's been
playing some impenetrable game.

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,320
My brother and I thought that
you might be more reasonable.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,678
Oh, you mean softer?

6
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:15,261
Now you know me better.

7
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:18,457
- She's a fella.
- You're drunk, Sowden.

8
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:19,982
Thomas, I want you to
take your father home,

9
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:21,070
and then I want you to come back.

10
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:22,428
You're going nowhere!

11
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:26,803
You said a hungry pig will
eat anything and everything.

12
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,803
Miss Walker might make
a companion for me.

13
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:32,553
I don't want you to be hurt.

14
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:36,303
You're playing with fire.

15
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,424
I have defended that woman

16
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:52,178
ever since she was in her teens.

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,690
Ever since she began staying

18
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:55,807
with her aunt and uncle at Shibden Hall,

19
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:59,925
I have defended her
against the vilest insults

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,628
and innuendo, through thick and thin,

21
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:05,427
because I never once
thought any of it was true,

22
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:07,720
because I was fond of her.

23
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:11,094
And, of course, now I
realize only too vividly

24
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:12,887
what a laughingstock I've been.

25
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,507
- Good Lord.
- I told them.

26
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,762
I said, "You're playing with fire."

27
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,780
Your cousin laughed as I left.

28
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:20,604
I could hear her. She laughed.

29
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:22,200
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

30
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:25,200
Do you think I could make
up something like that?

31
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:29,646
Two men were hanged outside York Jail

32
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,007
- just three months ago...
- I know.

33
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:33,934
In front of a crowd of 6,000 people

34
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,626
for unnatural acts.

35
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:37,318
I know. I know that.

36
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:42,539
You mustn't repeat it
to anyone, any of it, ever.

37
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:45,384
- Why?
- Because you can't let yourself,

38
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:47,094
either of us,

39
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:49,132
or my cousin, Miss Walker,

40
00:01:49,157 --> 00:01:51,228
be associated with that sort of talk.

41
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:52,628
I didn't do anything.

42
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:54,428
Anne Lister is clever.

43
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:56,370
She'll twist it. She'll turn it.

44
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:59,428
She'll make it reflect more
badly on you than on herself.

45
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:01,841
She could run rings

46
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:03,675
around Lord Grey and his cabinet

47
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,075
if she got anywhere near them.

48
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,570
She did try to deny it,

49
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:07,928
even in the room,

50
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,194
as though it was all in my imagination.

51
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:13,327
The best thing, the only response,

52
00:02:13,352 --> 00:02:16,678
is to be rather more cool in future,

53
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,702
to establish some distance,

54
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:22,061
and certainly not to refer
to them in company.

55
00:02:22,086 --> 00:02:23,211
The thing is,

56
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:25,394
about not mentioning it to anyone,

57
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:29,519
I was at Stoney Royd a few days ago,

58
00:02:29,602 --> 00:02:31,131
and so I may have mentioned it

59
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:33,068
to elderly Mrs. Rawson.

60
00:02:34,352 --> 00:02:36,721
I did... mention it

61
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,541
to elderly Mrs. Rawson.

62
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,962
And Mrs. Stansfield
Rawson, she was there, too,

63
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:45,170
with Miss Catherine
and Miss Delia Rawson.

64
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,852
And then to your Aunt Ann at Cliffhill.

65
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:50,990
So I'm afraid...

66
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,219
yes,

67
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:55,914
it has been mentioned.

- To York?
- Yesterday.

71
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:32,797
In your cousin's carriage.

72
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:34,807
- Both of them?
- Why?

73
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:37,540
To consult a doctor about her spine

74
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,994
and her... nerves.

75
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,084
Nervy... nerve business.

76
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:43,702
She has a doctor here.

77
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:46,303
Miss Lister's line was that Dr. Belcombe

78
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:48,286
is "no provincial quack."

79
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,228
Dr. Kenny is a very properly
trained medical man.

80
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,852
It's an excuse to get
her away from her family

81
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:55,169
and on her own.

82
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,987
The unspoken, William,

83
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:58,635
is not always the unknown.

84
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:03,144
She'll have her in
Paris before we know it.

85
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:19,545
Would you like a posy?

86
00:04:42,686 --> 00:04:43,852
Uh-oh.

87
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:46,103
Dr. Belcombe will be here in 20 minutes.

88
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,811
- Oh.
- Oh, Ann, no.

89
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:02,986
She's getting dressed.

90
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,644
It was good of you to see her
at such short notice, Steph.

91
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:07,878
Ah.

92
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:10,296
Well, I've examined her, and
we've had a good long chat

93
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,655
about her family and so forth.

94
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:14,769
I can give her something
for the pain in her back,

95
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:17,386
but its root cause is nervous hysteria.

96
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,644
Does that mean it's all in her head?

97
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:22,252
That's not to dismiss it, of course,

98
00:05:22,277 --> 00:05:23,935
and I've explained this to her.

99
00:05:24,936 --> 00:05:26,695
Mental suffering is just as acute

100
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,845
as physical suffering, but of course,

101
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,452
we can't see it in the same way

102
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:31,751
that we can see physical suffering,

103
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,884
so we tend to dismiss it.

104
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:37,335
She's had a lot of sadness
to contend with in her life.

105
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,810
We all cope with things
in different ways, of course.

106
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:44,302
Some people are better equipped
to deal with it than others.

107
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,094
Hmm.

108
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:47,620
Tell me what I can do to help.

109
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:48,844
I think you're doing it, Anne.

110
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:51,079
I think you're probably the best thing

111
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:52,223
that's ever happened to her.

112
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,686
She says she feels like
a fraud now she's here,

113
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,727
because she's felt so different

114
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:58,961
since you befriended her.

115
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:01,616
Did you say you were
thinking of traveling abroad?

116
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:03,035
Yes.

117
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,161
Well, then if you can persuade her,

118
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,696
it'll do her more good than
anything I can prescribe.

119
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:08,922
Oh, she wants to go.

120
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:10,307
Well, then that's half the battle.

121
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:14,727
Have you heard from my sister lately?

122
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:16,228
Yes.

123
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:17,327
Yes, I wrote to her,

124
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:19,519
told her we were coming to see you.

125
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:22,852
What scintillating
chitchat from Miss Lister?

126
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:24,058
Oh, she's in York.

127
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:26,786
She's taking someone to see Steph...

128
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:30,602
one of her neighbors, a Miss Walker.

129
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:32,352
A Miss Walker?

130
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,522
Of course.

131
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:39,878
Is there no end to Miss
Lister's selflessness?

132
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:53,954
Must've shaken you, William.

133
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:56,587
The accident above the
hall the other week.

134
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:58,195
Yes, ma'am. It wasn't pleasant.

135
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:01,039
The little boy lost a leg. Did you hear?

136
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:03,852
Sounds like the idiot driving the gig

137
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:05,278
didn't know how to handle the thing.

138
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:07,072
Couldn't say, ma'am.
It all happened so fast.

139
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,909
You were facing him, as I understand it,

140
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:11,050
as he approached.

141
00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:12,678
Like I say,

142
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:15,541
it was all over and done with
before we knew what was going on.

143
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,327
James Mackenzie told me
that just after it happened,

144
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:23,352
you said you recognized
the man driving the gig

145
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:24,719
as Mr. Christopher Rawson.

146
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:28,726
They're my tenants... the Hardcastles.

147
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:30,508
They're my people,

148
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:33,519
and I'd like to know the truth.

149
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:38,212
Both my brothers work
for Mr. Rawson, ma'am,

150
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:40,782
and with him being
magistrate himself, it...

151
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:44,020
Well, it's not as if
it'd even do any good, is it?

152
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:45,474
There are other magistrates in Halifax.

153
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,748
Oh, aye, and they all p...

154
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:48,569
piss in the same pot.

155
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:51,978
Anyway, I could have been mistaken.

156
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:54,160
Could've been anyone.

157
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:56,311
Ah.

158
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:09,611
Is Eugénie all right?

159
00:08:10,952 --> 00:08:13,577
Oh, she gets travel-sick. She's useless.

160
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:16,144
Oh.

161
00:08:29,186 --> 00:08:30,261
Thomas?

162
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:32,577
Mr. Washington.

163
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:33,685
How's things at home?

164
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,784
Uh, same.

165
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:36,544
Any sign of him?

166
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:38,492
Nothing, no.

167
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:39,908
How's your mother?

168
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:43,361
It's a heck of a thing,

169
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:46,435
a fellow walking out
on his family like that.

170
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,286
I just wish we knew what
was happening with tenancy,

171
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,435
and then we'd know
what we were doing, sir.

172
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,870
All right, we'll have to see

173
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,578
if Miss Lister's had any
more thoughts on the matter

174
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:55,519
when she's back from York, won't we?

175
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:19,578
Dr. Belcombe was very pleased with me...

176
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,119
- Very pleased.
- And sees no reason

177
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,370
why I shouldn't make a full recovery.

178
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:24,186
- A full recovery.
- And not only did he say

179
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:25,669
there was no reason whatsoever

180
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:26,995
why I shouldn't travel abroad,

181
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:28,435
but he said it would do me good.

182
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,545
Well, Dr. Kenny said exactly
the same thing weeks ago.

183
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,520
Can you not see a difference
in Miss Walker already,

184
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:35,586
Miss Walker?

185
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:39,153
Well, everyone has been
asking where you were:

186
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:41,310
the Priestleys, the Rawsons,

187
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:43,610
Mr. and Mrs. Edwards at Pine Nest.

188
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:47,061
Everyone's been talking about you.

189
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:48,744
We were only gone three days.

190
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,794
Yes, but it wasn't like you.
That was the anxiety.

191
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:53,988
I feel...

192
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,235
I feel different. I feel better.

193
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,484
And come January,

194
00:09:58,509 --> 00:09:59,843
our plan is to travel,

195
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,615
first across to the Continent,

196
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,566
then through Switzerland,
and then on to Rome.

197
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:05,888
For Easter, for the carnival.

198
00:10:05,913 --> 00:10:08,222
And then back to England
and then up to Scotland

199
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:09,831
to see Elizabeth and the children.

200
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:11,106
You must never forget

201
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:13,870
your brother died in Naples.

202
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:15,856
Well, that's not...

203
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,310
Italy's...

204
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:19,477
I've been several times,

205
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:21,419
and I've never once felt
the least bit queasy.

206
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:24,535
Quite the opposite, in fact.

207
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,902
The climate at Easter
will be the perfect tonic.

208
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:30,863
It appears that you have my niece

209
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:33,804
quite under your spell, Miss Lister.

210
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:35,637
Oh?

211
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:38,008
I rather think she has me under hers.

212
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:42,328
Aren't you delighted
to see me so well, Aunt?

213
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,426
Well, I'm afraid
I must burst your bubble.

214
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:49,144
There's a letter for you on the desk.

215
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:50,832
It arrived two days ago.

216
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,811
I'm sorry. I opened it.

217
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:55,779
It was misdirected here,

218
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:57,936
and I didn't realize it wasn't for me.

219
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:00,769
Who?

220
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:03,011
It's your friend Mrs. Ainsworth.

221
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:06,478
Ann.

222
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,797
Ann, are you all right?

223
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:11,171
Your Uncle Edward's made some inquiries,

224
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:15,186
and apparently, she was
thrown out of an open carriage.

225
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:18,560
Here, here. Shh, shh, shh.

226
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:20,501
But they... they're coming here.

227
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,818
They... they're coming here next week!

228
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,811
Do you have any brandy
or smelling salts?

229
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,186
They're burying her on Monday.

230
00:11:31,644 --> 00:11:32,906
Well, she's back from York,

231
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:35,597
but Miss Walker's had bad news...

232
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,290
a bereavement...

233
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:39,782
so she's staying over
there with her tonight.

234
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:41,099
Oh, dear.

235
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,469
Thank you, Eugénie.

236
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,095
And before I forget,
before she does come back,

237
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,786
just to warn you,

238
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:52,061
after you went off to Market Weighton,

239
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:54,305
I did... I might have...

240
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:57,191
The name of Mr. Abbott

241
00:11:57,894 --> 00:11:59,435
may have escaped my lips.

242
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,769
- What?
- In front of Anne.

243
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:02,794
Oh!

244
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,139
No, it was an accident. It slipped out.

245
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:07,082
I played it down. And I'm sure...

246
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:09,955
There's nothing wrong with
you seeing someone, Marian.

247
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,910
If you want to invite someone to tea,

248
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:14,553
you invite someone to tea.

249
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,991
But, Jeremy, he makes carpets.

250
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:18,405
He's a founder member

251
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,006
of the Joint Stock
Halifax Banking Company.

252
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:24,769
Our father's father's father

253
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:26,177
was a wool merchant.

254
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,491
She forgets that.

255
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:32,269
She conveniently forgets
that when she's doing her,

256
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,715
"15 generations

257
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,786
and between two and three centuries,

258
00:12:35,811 --> 00:12:38,186
all the way back to Charlemagne."

259
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:40,356
Trade.

260
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:43,569
We are descended from trade,

261
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,967
just like the rest.

262
00:13:02,204 --> 00:13:03,930
Love, you all right?

263
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:19,826
Come here. Shh.

264
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:22,853
Come on, let's sit you down.

265
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:25,628
I'll get you some tea...

266
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:27,477
with a bit of sugar.

267
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,969
Let's help ourselves
to a bit of sugar for you, eh?

268
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:34,586
What's up?

269
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:36,728
I'll tell you later.

270
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:46,912
I keep thinking he's gonna
come through that door

271
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:48,135
and murder us all.

272
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:51,902
Yeah.

273
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,739
I'm sure he has it in him.

274
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:57,928
Amy's been crying again.

275
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:00,810
Why?

276
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:02,639
Oh, happen she misses him.

277
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,317
God knows why. I don't.

278
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,519
Only I wish we knew what we were doing.

279
00:14:07,602 --> 00:14:09,954
Well, she's supposed to
be back from York today,

280
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,003
Miss Lister, so I'll try and talk to her

281
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,194
when I see her.

282
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:16,321
She'll no'an help us.

283
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,169
You don't know.

284
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:20,736
You know, what I can't fathom

285
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:24,419
is why he'd not take
any of his things, eh?

286
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,745
There's a brand-new pair of boots

287
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:26,986
under that bed upstairs.

288
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,038
And his cart.

289
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:30,616
Why'd he not go over to the big house

290
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,782
and fetch his cart, eh?

291
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:34,852
Happen he's walked to Liverpool,

292
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:37,627
sneaked on board a packet,
and sailed to America.

293
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:41,094
He once told me that's what he'd do,

294
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:42,987
if he could.

295
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:44,299
When?

296
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:46,393
Years ago.

297
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:49,469
- When?
- Years ago.

298
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,081
No, we'll not see him again.

299
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,167
We were nothing but
an inconvenience to him.

300
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,644
Years ago.

301
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:15,722
And I never found another one.

302
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,051
But...

303
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:24,186
job...

304
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,980
my leg...

305
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:46,250
So I'm stuck here, jack-of-all-trades.

306
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:48,993
Still...

307
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:51,686
It's nice to belong somewhere.

308
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,310
Oh, no.

309
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:06,532
Get it all out.

310
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:10,644
What's happened?

311
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:41,946
Do you want to talk about her...

312
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:45,118
Mrs. Ainsworth?

313
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:47,200
She was...

314
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:50,336
kind.

315
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:55,802
You must have been very close to her.

316
00:16:58,811 --> 00:16:59,869
Why do you say that?

317
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:05,103
Because you're so upset.

318
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:08,666
Not close like we are,

319
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:11,165
if that's what you're thinking.

320
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:19,918
It's death.

321
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,977
It's anything to do with death.

322
00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:32,042
Terrifies me.

323
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:01,255
I wonder

324
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:05,023
if we should pay a house call
on Mr. and Mrs. Priestley.

325
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,882
What?

326
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:10,058
Now, this morning, first thing.

327
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,070
Why?

328
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:15,252
Because...

329
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:18,911
if we skulk and avoid her,

330
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:20,453
it'll look like
we have something to hide,

331
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:22,411
something to be ashamed
of, and we haven't.

332
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,744
We don't.

333
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:26,235
We're just two respectable women

334
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,830
who choose to spend time
together, and that's all.

335
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:32,269
She saw us...

336
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:34,602
kissing.

337
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:35,810
She didn't.

338
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:39,969
Well, not exactly, but the point is...

339
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:44,459
if she says anything to anyone,

340
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:47,065
which she may or may
not do... who knows...

341
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:50,061
if we carry on as normal,

342
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:51,698
as if we have nothing to hide,

343
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,143
it'll undermine anything
she might go around saying,

344
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:59,331
whereas if we avoid polite company,

345
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:03,896
it might reinforce the idea
that what she says

346
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,834
has some truth in it.

347
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,756
Must we do it now, today?

348
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:13,037
I always think it's better
to broach these things head-on

349
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:14,560
and deal with them.

350
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,369
You could tell them
how you got on in York.

351
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:20,435
Really, they ought to be delighted.

352
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:28,452
So will Mr. Ainsworth

353
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:30,961
still come for his meeting
with the church trustees?

354
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:33,875
We haven't heard anything else.

355
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:37,019
He could always stay here with us

356
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:39,293
rather than with you, if that's helpful.

357
00:19:39,357 --> 00:19:41,066
Maybe I should write to him.

358
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:42,619
As one of the church trustees,

359
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:44,061
I will be meeting with him anyway.

360
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:45,103
Thank you.

361
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:47,130
And make the offer.

362
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:51,729
Such sad news.

363
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:55,452
What a shame you didn't see Miss Walker

364
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:57,305
when she'd just returned from York.

365
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:00,641
She was a different person altogether.

366
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:02,228
Weren't you?

367
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:08,267
Dr. Belcombe was...
very pleased with me.

368
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:12,136
And sees no reason why
she shouldn't make a full recovery.

369
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:19,422
And his prescription is to travel,

370
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:22,462
so...

371
00:20:28,536 --> 00:20:29,728
That went well.

372
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,745
Did it?

373
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:33,841
Well enough.

374
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:39,560
Listen, I've got to get back to Shibden.

375
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:40,811
Oh.

376
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:43,310
I've got things to do, people to see.

377
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:52,269
- Morning.
- Morning, ma'am.

378
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:55,845
Marian.

379
00:20:57,144 --> 00:20:58,352
How was Market Weighton?

380
00:20:58,826 --> 00:20:59,900
Pleasant.

381
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:03,169
Good.

382
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:04,951
How's Miss Walker?

383
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:06,067
Very...

384
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,336
Well, she was, and then this
bereavement knocked her for six.

385
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,703
Jeremiah Rawson's here to see you again.

386
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:15,236
Hmm.

387
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:17,269
I've got to go into Halifax.

388
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:18,628
I've got to go into Halifax.

389
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:21,722
I'm going down a pit.

390
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:22,998
I'll come with you.

391
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:26,602
Not down the pit, just into Halifax.

392
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:31,560
I hear you've been to York.

393
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:33,144
Is that of interest to you?

394
00:21:33,228 --> 00:21:34,411
Only that it would have been helpful

395
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,394
to have sorted this
business before you went.

396
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,220
To you, perhaps. To me,
as I keep telling you,

397
00:21:38,244 --> 00:21:39,561
it's a matter of indifference.

398
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:44,086
The trip was all a bit last-minute.

399
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:47,560
I'm thinking of buying a new gig.

400
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,120
Am I right in thinking your brother

401
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:51,389
bought a new gig recently?

402
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:52,477
Yes, yes, he did.

403
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:53,836
He didn't like it, so he sent it

404
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:55,286
back to the manufacturer in Liverpool.

405
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,269
Not a company he'd recommend, then.

406
00:21:57,352 --> 00:21:58,602
Is there a name,

407
00:21:58,686 --> 00:21:59,894
so I can avoid it?

408
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:02,870
Oh, uh... I can find out.

409
00:22:02,895 --> 00:22:04,698
- Would you?
- But it would be very nice

410
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,389
if we could settle about the coal.

411
00:22:06,414 --> 00:22:07,583
- When was that?
- What?

412
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:08,732
When he sent it back.

413
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,461
Four, five weeks ago. Why?

414
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:17,597
So, like you,

415
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:19,786
I was at a loss to account

416
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:21,307
for the misunderstanding between us.

417
00:22:22,386 --> 00:22:25,302
Why you imagine I'd sell
both beds at that price

418
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:26,852
is a mystery after I'd adumbrated

419
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:28,251
my calculations so deftly.

420
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:29,662
But with the price being so steep,

421
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:31,811
I imagined it did cover both beds.

422
00:22:31,836 --> 00:22:32,911
No.

423
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:38,228
So I value the upper
bed, if you want it,

424
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,739
at £160 per acre.

425
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:43,949
However, I'm prepared
to make an abatement on this

426
00:22:43,974 --> 00:22:46,263
and sell it to you at
£139 and ten shillings

427
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:47,830
per acre to show good faith,

428
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:50,076
but the price of the lower bed
remains the same.

429
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:54,336
I realize you'll have
to consult your brother,

430
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:56,827
but I would like an answer
before the end of the week

431
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,726
so I can offer it
to the other applicant,

432
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,067
if that's what it comes to.

433
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:06,844
Miss Lister, you do know

434
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:10,061
that my brother isn't
someone to mess with,

435
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:11,170
don't you?

436
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,510
Are you threatening me?

437
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:14,363
No, I'm not.

438
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,811
I'm telling you for your own good.

439
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:24,985
I'm sorry

440
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:27,359
that we argued before I went away.

441
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:29,795
I... I said things I regret,

442
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:31,378
and I apologize.

443
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:33,589
I don't like it when we
argue any more than you do.

444
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:35,661
No, I know that, and I'm sorry.

445
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:37,894
I know you think it doesn't
affect me, but it does.

446
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,186
That's why I'm apologizing.

447
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,502
It upsets my equilibrium.

448
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:42,366
I know. It upsets mine too,

449
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:43,475
and I'm sorry.

450
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:49,029
I'm going to Jackson's for
flannel to make drawers.

451
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,686
Can I get you any?

452
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:53,240
I've got a new pattern
with an improved gusset.

453
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:55,459
I can make you some if you like.

454
00:23:56,186 --> 00:24:00,103
Actually, I am planning on
traveling again in February

455
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:01,169
with Miss Walker,

456
00:24:01,694 --> 00:24:03,127
Aunt Anne's health permitting.

457
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:05,311
So yes,

458
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:07,348
new drawers would be useful.

459
00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:11,469
You've become great
friends, you and Miss Walker.

460
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:13,891
Hmm.

461
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,769
If she were to move
in with me at Shibden

462
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:22,027
as my companion,

463
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:24,011
how would you feel about that?

464
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:26,019
Would she leave Crow Nest?

465
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:27,543
She says so.

466
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:29,466
She rattles around in it on her own.

467
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:30,903
Oh, I'd be delighted.

468
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:33,310
- Would you?
- Of course!

469
00:24:33,335 --> 00:24:35,164
I like her, the little I've seen of her,

470
00:24:35,189 --> 00:24:37,856
and... I'd be pleased for you

471
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:39,467
to be more settled.

472
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:43,647
Thank you, Marian.

473
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:46,944
There was one thing I did say

474
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,744
before I went off to Market Weighton

475
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,037
which may have overstepped the mark

476
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:54,435
but, at the same time,
wasn't entirely inaccurate.

477
00:24:55,435 --> 00:24:59,024
I believe Aunt Anne has
mentioned Mr. Abbott to you.

478
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,751
Anne. Anne!

479
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,560
His name did escape her lips, yes.

480
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:07,085
I'd like to invite him to tea.

481
00:25:07,142 --> 00:25:08,558
Father says I can. In fact...

482
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:10,248
- Really?
- He'd like me to.

483
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,911
Well, then do you need my permission?

484
00:25:12,936 --> 00:25:15,019
It was more your blessing and...

485
00:25:16,103 --> 00:25:19,228
an undertaking that
you'd be civil to him.

486
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:21,978
You'll find me no obstacle

487
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:24,461
to something you have
very much at heart, Marian,

488
00:25:24,602 --> 00:25:26,772
as long as it's an intelligent choice,

489
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,305
but one would only be doing
one's duty as an elder sister

490
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,936
to question the pedigree
of a man who makes rugs.

491
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:37,820
Anne!

492
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:58,192
- Miss Lister!
- Mr. Holt.

493
00:25:58,217 --> 00:25:59,801
I have the figures for you, ma'am,

494
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:02,560
both for sinking a new
pit at the top of the hill

495
00:26:02,585 --> 00:26:04,627
and for reopening Listerwick.

496
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:11,435
What's that?

497
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,869
That's just an occupational hazard.

498
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:14,319
The ceiling's low in places,

499
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:15,453
and they will forget their caps,

500
00:26:15,477 --> 00:26:16,936
and then they graze their skulls.

501
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:18,453
Either that, or they bust their ankles

502
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,811
letting the carts catch
up with their heels.

503
00:26:22,144 --> 00:26:23,194
How old is...

504
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:25,558
That one? Uh...

505
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,917
pfft, don't know. Six, seven, eight.

506
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:30,477
It's better if they don't get too big.

507
00:26:30,618 --> 00:26:32,869
Track's narrow in places and low,

508
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:34,878
so it's just easier for them all round

509
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:36,570
if they don't fill out too much.

510
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:38,523
Are you still determined

511
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:39,989
to go down there yourself, ma'am?

512
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:57,103
Keep your 'ead down, mister.

513
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:29,415
How many people do you employ?

514
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,190
This pit? 14.

515
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:33,007
Five men, three women, six boys,

516
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:35,027
except some of them are girls.

517
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,127
And how do the shifts work?

518
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:40,960
Two 12-hour shifts,
ma'am. Round the clock.

519
00:27:41,644 --> 00:27:43,394
Demand is insatiable,

520
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:44,787
and of course, down
here, it don't matter

521
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:46,120
whether it's 10:00 in the morning

522
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,202
or 10:00 at night.

523
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:50,452
And that model would work for my pit?

524
00:27:50,477 --> 00:27:52,978
Once it's sunk. This
is a horizontal shaft.

525
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:55,586
Yours would be vertical
with a winding engine,

526
00:27:55,727 --> 00:27:58,519
which is what makes your setup costs

527
00:27:58,544 --> 00:27:59,886
that much more expensive.

528
00:28:00,884 --> 00:28:02,717
£2,000 is a lot of money.

529
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:04,560
It is indeed, ma'am,

530
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:06,627
but you'll be laughing
when profits come in

531
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,777
and for years to come.

532
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,811
So there I am, knee-deep in water,

533
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:16,950
and it struck me that
I ought to add another clause

534
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:18,683
to the lease with the Rawsons

535
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:21,061
to stop them from turning
the water back on me

536
00:28:21,144 --> 00:28:22,827
when they've finished loosening my coal.

537
00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:25,057
Might I ask, Miss Lister,

538
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:27,823
what is your strategy

539
00:28:28,602 --> 00:28:30,502
as regards this business
with the Rawsons,

540
00:28:31,686 --> 00:28:32,735
just to be clear?

541
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,827
I want them to know that I know

542
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:43,352
that they've been stealing my coal,

543
00:28:43,377 --> 00:28:45,336
even if we can't name it as such...

544
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:47,703
- Hmm.
- And for them to pay for it fairly,

545
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,280
and I want them to know
that I'm not someone

546
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,519
who will turn a blind
eye or be intimidated,

547
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:54,912
and as soon as I can,
I shall get down there myself

548
00:28:54,936 --> 00:28:56,186
and deal with them properly,

549
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,858
but that's going to take time.

550
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:04,310
Christopher Rawson is a bully
and an opportunist.

551
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:06,228
He's certainly no gentleman.

552
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:08,894
Doesn't surprise me they've
been stealing from your beds.

553
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:12,852
Oh, Jeremiah's decent enough,
left to his own devices,

554
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:14,810
but he's terrified of Christopher.

555
00:29:16,425 --> 00:29:19,633
If anyone's equal to him, it's you.

556
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:22,991
But, uh, he will play dirty.

557
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,244
Word has it that he caused
the accident above the hall

558
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:28,460
where the boy lost his leg.

559
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,686
Five weeks ago, he had a new gig,

560
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,410
and then he decided very suddenly

561
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:34,995
that he didn't like it
anymore, sent it back

562
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:36,287
to the manufacturer in Liverpool.

563
00:29:36,311 --> 00:29:37,412
No witnesses?

564
00:29:37,886 --> 00:29:39,219
None that will testify.

565
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,703
Ah.

566
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:44,198
Sadly, sending a gig
back to the manufacturer

567
00:29:44,223 --> 00:29:46,199
isn't really proof of very much.

568
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,242
No.

569
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:51,365
Oh, and another thing,

570
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,366
nothing to do with Christopher Rawson...

571
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:55,036
not that I know of.

572
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:57,228
I've heard a tenant disappeared.

573
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,435
Mm.

574
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,786
He's left his family behind.

575
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:02,521
Samuel Sowden, over
at Upper Sowden Farm.

576
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,919
I need to know what
to do about the tenancy.

577
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:44,817
Miss Lister.

578
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:47,519
- Is she...
- No, ma'am.

579
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:49,045
She's in the library.

580
00:30:50,897 --> 00:30:51,938
What's the matter?

581
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,236
I came as quickly as I could.

582
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:00,911
I...

583
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,707
I've had a letter from...

584
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,271
Mr. Ainsworth.

585
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,144
And?

586
00:31:14,477 --> 00:31:17,178
An account of Mrs. Ainsworth's last day

587
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:21,438
and how kind she was
to some poor people,

588
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,547
and then...

589
00:31:23,621 --> 00:31:25,121
the accident.

590
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:28,144
I think he wants to marry me,

591
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:32,056
and I think he wants to propose to me.

592
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:42,909
Can I see it?

593
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:44,519
- What?
- The letter.

594
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,602
Oh, no.

595
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,231
What do you mean, you think

596
00:31:58,144 --> 00:31:59,644
he's going to propose to you?

597
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:03,194
The intention's clear.

598
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:04,867
Can I not see it?

599
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:06,308
It's marked private.

600
00:32:06,406 --> 00:32:07,931
Well, I won't tell him.

601
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:18,378
Well, he's quick off the mark,

602
00:32:19,472 --> 00:32:21,128
with his wife not yet buried.

603
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,228
An offer of marriage...
it's not something

604
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:27,629
to be sniffed at or treated lightly,

605
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:29,811
and a curate too, a man of God!

606
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:31,134
What more could any woman want?

607
00:32:31,186 --> 00:32:32,618
- You're cross.
- Am I?

608
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:35,813
I don't... I don't want to marry him.

609
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:37,860
I want to be with you.

610
00:32:38,644 --> 00:32:39,686
Well, then...

611
00:32:48,477 --> 00:32:49,519
No, it's...

612
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,936
An offer of marriage

613
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:54,658
isn't something to be sneezed at.

614
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,629
And obviously,

615
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:03,426
it needs some consideration.

616
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,789
A clergyman's wife.

617
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:13,492
And who knows? A mother...

618
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:15,852
in the fullness of time

619
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:17,162
and then maybe one day a grandmother,

620
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:18,495
and then you really would have fulfilled

621
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,572
your destiny on this planet as a woman.

622
00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:24,002
I...

623
00:33:24,498 --> 00:33:27,160
I've been so in love with you.

624
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,384
I always have been,

625
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:31,011
ever since the first time I saw you

626
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:33,822
when I was 18... younger!

627
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:36,805
I think the first time
I ever saw you, I was 14,

628
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,057
and then I knew then.

629
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,541
I just... I knew, and...

630
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,319
It's just utterly clear to me now.

631
00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:46,186
So often, whenever I've thought of it,

632
00:33:46,211 --> 00:33:49,285
I've just felt a repugnance

633
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,452
towards forming any sort
of connection with a man,

634
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,792
but I...

635
00:34:01,877 --> 00:34:03,543
She was a lot older than him.

636
00:34:05,505 --> 00:34:06,523
Sorry?

637
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,822
Mrs. Ainsworth, she...

638
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,952
she was 15 years older than him, and...

639
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:21,100
Once or twice, she would joke...

640
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,486
at least I always
thought it was a joke...

641
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:28,848
that she would die first, and then...

642
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:31,527
who would look after Thomas?

643
00:34:33,602 --> 00:34:36,144
And she'd say, "It'll
have to be you, Annie."

644
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,915
Why won't you let me see the letter?

645
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,344
Because...

646
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:49,178
What?

647
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,074
I told you, it's marked private.

648
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:26,525
Anne?

649
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:41,703
You're going to have to make a decision.

650
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:46,232
There's clearly more to it

651
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:47,999
than you're able or willing to tell me.

652
00:35:52,636 --> 00:35:55,886
So he will require an answer,

653
00:35:55,911 --> 00:35:59,661
I assume, as much as I do
to this alleged proposal.

654
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:01,978
No, he hasn't actually asked me yet.

655
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:03,011
No,

656
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:05,539
but for some reason, it would appear

657
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,647
to be on the cards,

658
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:09,655
and it would be good
to have an answer ready,

659
00:36:10,983 --> 00:36:12,061
so...

660
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:16,492
Ah, today's Friday.

661
00:36:17,897 --> 00:36:21,038
I propose you have the weekend
to think it over, and...

662
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,605
instead of giving me your yes or no

663
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,857
on the 3rd of April,

664
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,245
I'd like it first thing Monday morning,

665
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:31,310
and then we both of us
know what we're doing.

666
00:36:31,335 --> 00:36:34,877
I can't make such
a big decision so quickly!

667
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,186
Do you think I should marry him?

668
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:41,303
That...

669
00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:47,470
Only you can decide something like that.

670
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:51,875
Most people

671
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:56,519
would think I'd be
foolish not to at my age,

672
00:36:56,544 --> 00:36:58,045
wouldn't they?

673
00:36:59,936 --> 00:37:02,728
Yes.

674
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,646
Yes, they would.

675
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:12,680
Would we still see each other?

676
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:13,813
No.

677
00:37:15,477 --> 00:37:18,000
I think if you take him,
you'd have to give me up.

678
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:21,007
No, but not as friends.
Only as this, Anne.

679
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:23,644
How could we go back to
common friendship now?

680
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:30,923
No.

681
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:36,769
You must think it through carefully,

682
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:38,662
because you'll have to live
with the consequences,

683
00:37:38,686 --> 00:37:39,869
whichever way you decide.

684
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:40,977
We both will.

685
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,728
And there'll be no going
back on it once it's made,

686
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:47,769
but I think it would be very unlikely

687
00:37:47,794 --> 00:37:49,052
that we could remain friends

688
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,852
after all that's passed between us.

689
00:37:51,877 --> 00:37:53,579
I think it would be too painful.

690
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,602
Why do I have to decide on Monday?

691
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:05,396
Because we have to
know what we're doing.

692
00:38:08,644 --> 00:38:10,174
I have to know what I'm doing.

693
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:24,969
I behaved as well as I could.

694
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,702
Though perpetually saying to myself,

695
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:30,061
"Well, I care not how she decides;

696
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,744
I care not much for her;

697
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:33,846
the whole thing was only ever a game,"

698
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:37,370
as I left, she hung upon me

699
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:39,285
and cried and sobbed aloud at parting,

700
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:43,186
saying, "I hope we shall meet
under happier circumstances."

701
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,860
"Well," said I to myself
as I walked off,

702
00:38:52,936 --> 00:38:55,310
"a pretty scene we have had,

703
00:38:55,394 --> 00:38:57,936
but surely I care not much,

704
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,636
and I shall take my time of suspense

705
00:38:59,661 --> 00:39:02,222
very quietly and be easily reconciled

706
00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:03,644
either way."

707
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:46,477
Don't do this to me.

708
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,199
Don't you dare do this to me again.

709
00:40:07,728 --> 00:40:09,313
Jeremiah tells me

710
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:11,671
you've been letting Miss Lister

711
00:40:11,696 --> 00:40:15,061
run rings around you over her coal.

712
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:16,797
Christopher, is it true?

713
00:40:16,822 --> 00:40:18,639
No, Mother, it isn't.

714
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:22,783
That's not exactly how
I worded it, Mother.

715
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:26,320
Maneuvering you into
paying silly prices.

716
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:29,308
Trying to and failing miserably.

717
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:32,203
- She's very clever.
- Oh, we know she's clever.

718
00:40:32,228 --> 00:40:33,840
That's why I like her,

719
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:37,728
her company, her conversation,

720
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,574
even though she is a bit of an oddity.

721
00:40:40,876 --> 00:40:43,270
She's been to so many places,

722
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:45,493
done so many things.

723
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,108
Most women are dull and stupid...

724
00:40:50,271 --> 00:40:51,485
but not her.

725
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,827
Well, happily,

726
00:40:52,852 --> 00:40:54,560
I'm just as clever as she is,

727
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,877
and I have the measure of her.

728
00:40:55,902 --> 00:40:57,861
Oh, I doubt it!

729
00:40:57,886 --> 00:40:59,344
Cake?

730
00:40:59,661 --> 00:41:01,619
She's threatening to sink her own pits,

731
00:41:01,644 --> 00:41:04,361
so she has us over
a barrel as regards price,

732
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:06,010
given what's gone on.

733
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,416
You haven't been stealing
her coal, have you?

734
00:41:09,441 --> 00:41:10,524
What?

735
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:11,619
Nothing.

736
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:13,677
What did Stansfield say?

737
00:41:13,702 --> 00:41:14,844
Nothing, Mother.

738
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:16,602
I'm fast coming to the conclusion

739
00:41:16,627 --> 00:41:18,877
that she's bluffing about
sinking her own pits,

740
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:20,768
because how could she
possibly afford it?

741
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:24,402
And this latest demand is just nonsense.

742
00:41:24,427 --> 00:41:25,644
I'm tempted to tell her

743
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:28,252
where she can shove her upper bed...

744
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:31,310
sorry, ladies... and call her bluff.

745
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,061
Well, perhaps her little
friend will help her.

746
00:41:34,093 --> 00:41:35,927
She's got plenty of money.

747
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:38,223
Sorry, what? Who?

748
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:40,911
Miss Walker, your cousin!

749
00:41:42,894 --> 00:41:45,177
They went to York together, apparently,

750
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:48,043
and now they're inseparable.

751
00:41:48,068 --> 00:41:50,528
- Really?
- Next stop, Paris.

752
00:41:51,686 --> 00:41:54,352
Maybe Miss Walker will let Miss Lister

753
00:41:54,377 --> 00:41:56,261
dip into her purse.

754
00:41:57,602 --> 00:42:00,216
Whatever else she's been
letting her dip into.

755
00:42:02,902 --> 00:42:04,861
So sorry, ladies.

756
00:42:19,165 --> 00:42:21,535
Me and the lads generally stop

757
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,447
for us dinners about now, Miss Lister,

758
00:42:23,472 --> 00:42:24,661
if that's all right.

759
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:26,519
Yes, of course it is.

760
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,753
Jamie, lad.

761
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,403
I'll just do this, Mr. Booth.

762
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:30,858
Aye, good lad.

763
00:42:33,522 --> 00:42:34,892
He's a good lad.

764
00:42:36,269 --> 00:42:38,061
You should have a drop of beer,

765
00:42:38,086 --> 00:42:40,003
if nowt else, for your dinner, ma'am.

766
00:42:40,144 --> 00:42:42,103
You've been digging like the devil.

767
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:51,811
Mm...

768
00:42:58,477 --> 00:43:00,394
Need to talk to you

769
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:01,824
about you and Eugénie.

770
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:04,477
Really is an inconvenience.

771
00:43:04,502 --> 00:43:05,702
It's all off.

772
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:07,519
Sorry?

773
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:08,544
It's not happening,

774
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:11,027
so we're all all right.

775
00:43:11,228 --> 00:43:14,644
- Oh.
- Yep.

776
00:43:14,669 --> 00:43:15,702
What happened?

777
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,904
Nothing. Just, uh...

778
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:18,970
You know.

779
00:43:19,228 --> 00:43:21,694
'Course, as you said,
it were a step down for her.

780
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,442
It would never have done,

781
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:26,383
and she realized that

782
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:28,437
when she got back from York, so...

783
00:43:29,944 --> 00:43:32,193
She was very pale in York...

784
00:43:32,218 --> 00:43:33,510
and tearful.

785
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:37,119
I pretended not to notice, but...

786
00:43:44,569 --> 00:43:46,277
Was she pregnant?

787
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:49,244
Well, it wasn't mine.

788
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:51,970
It was George's, wasn't it?

789
00:43:53,845 --> 00:43:55,305
I thought they were getting on very well

790
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:57,227
in Hastings and in Langton, and then...

791
00:43:58,811 --> 00:44:00,017
Good Lord.

792
00:44:01,447 --> 00:44:03,245
I thought she was
preoccupied with something

793
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:04,814
when we got back here, but...

794
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,260
I just couldn't decide if it was just...

795
00:44:08,686 --> 00:44:10,620
you know, Shibden.

796
00:44:12,477 --> 00:44:14,560
I felt sorry for her.

797
00:44:14,644 --> 00:44:18,285
In a new place and
a load of unfamiliar faces,

798
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,602
and Mrs. Cordingley said... Cordingley?

799
00:44:20,627 --> 00:44:23,700
She confided in Mrs. Cordingley,

800
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:24,937
with her having a bit of French,

801
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:27,791
and we none of us knew
what to do to help her...

802
00:44:27,816 --> 00:44:28,907
Everyone?

803
00:44:29,936 --> 00:44:32,103
Sorry, all of the servants knew?

804
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:37,080
And Eliz... Mrs. Cordingley
said what she needed,

805
00:44:37,894 --> 00:44:39,400
what Eugénie needed,

806
00:44:40,103 --> 00:44:42,811
was a man with a good Christian heart

807
00:44:42,894 --> 00:44:45,950
to step in and do the decent thing.

808
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,138
Oh, John.

809
00:44:50,163 --> 00:44:52,886
Well, it weren't
entirely a selfless thing.

810
00:44:52,978 --> 00:44:55,952
I was... I am...

811
00:44:57,103 --> 00:44:58,627
a bit smitten with her.

812
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,735
You do realize you're too
good for her, don't you?

813
00:45:06,811 --> 00:45:07,986
Well, it's often the way

814
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:12,244
when you feel like that
about someone, isn't it?

815
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,827
It's very rare that both parties feel

816
00:45:15,852 --> 00:45:18,435
exactly the same about each other.

817
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,640
I don't know.

818
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:24,191
I think sometimes a
thing can start that way,

819
00:45:24,216 --> 00:45:25,225
but then...

820
00:45:25,962 --> 00:45:29,253
Will you... you won't dismiss her,

821
00:45:29,278 --> 00:45:30,362
will you?

822
00:45:32,144 --> 00:45:33,202
Hmm.

823
00:45:34,686 --> 00:45:35,728
Well,

824
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,811
proper French lady's
maids don't grow on trees,

825
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,216
certainly not in Halifax.

826
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:44,179
I don't know what shocks me most,

827
00:45:44,204 --> 00:45:45,435
the thing itself or

828
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:47,485
Cordingley not saying anything to me.

829
00:45:50,352 --> 00:45:52,494
Are you all right, ma'am?

830
00:45:57,019 --> 00:45:58,586
I'm always all right.

831
00:46:00,269 --> 00:46:01,560
Ma'am!

832
00:46:01,644 --> 00:46:03,051
- There you are.
- Hello.

833
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:06,302
- Hello, John.
- Mr. Washington.

834
00:46:07,507 --> 00:46:09,462
Young Thomas Sowden has asked me

835
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:12,413
to ask you if you've had
any further thoughts about their tenancy

836
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:14,546
since his father took off.

837
00:46:15,228 --> 00:46:16,303
Yes.

838
00:46:17,186 --> 00:46:18,278
I have.

839
00:46:24,894 --> 00:46:28,186
Come on. Come on.

840
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:31,727
Mom.

841
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:35,352
- Mrs. Sowden?
- Yes.

842
00:46:35,435 --> 00:46:38,352
It's a letter from my
father, Mr. Washington,

843
00:46:38,435 --> 00:46:40,435
on behalf of Miss Lister
about your tenancy.

844
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,376
I like your pigs, Mrs. Sowden.

845
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:44,268
I'd like to farm pigs meself.

846
00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:47,061
Just ignore her. She talks too much.

847
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,802
Can either of you girls read?

848
00:46:51,686 --> 00:46:52,977
Thomas?

849
00:46:54,644 --> 00:46:58,500
Thomas, there's a letter from
Mr. Washington about the tenancy.

850
00:47:00,894 --> 00:47:02,103
Hello!

851
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:05,176
Hello.

852
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:07,222
Hello.

853
00:47:07,247 --> 00:47:08,403
Would you mind?

854
00:47:12,228 --> 00:47:14,656
"Dear Thomas and Mrs. Sowden,

855
00:47:15,297 --> 00:47:16,576
Miss Lister confirm"...

856
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:20,786
Can never read his spidery writing.

857
00:47:20,811 --> 00:47:24,119
Um, "Miss Lister
confirmed this afternoon,

858
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:27,103
following a conversation
with her lawyer, Mr. Parker,

859
00:47:27,128 --> 00:47:28,711
in Halifax yesterday,

860
00:47:28,797 --> 00:47:31,033
that if Samuel has
not returned to the farm

861
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:32,892
within a period of two months,

862
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:34,375
as of today's date,

863
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:36,327
she will be obliged to terminate

864
00:47:36,352 --> 00:47:37,686
her agreement with him

865
00:47:37,711 --> 00:47:39,628
as regards to the tenancy of the farm."

866
00:47:39,653 --> 00:47:40,670
What?

867
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:42,103
Hold on.

868
00:47:42,128 --> 00:47:45,019
"At that point, however, she also"...

869
00:47:45,044 --> 00:47:46,127
What?

870
00:47:46,893 --> 00:47:49,352
"Confirms that she will offer"...

871
00:47:49,377 --> 00:47:51,628
"Confirms that she will offer

872
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:54,361
a six-month tenancy to you, Thomas,

873
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:57,744
at the same price your
father pays presently."

874
00:48:03,852 --> 00:48:06,061
Can I go and look at your
pigs now, Mrs. Sowden?

875
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:09,244
Of course you can. Amy,
you take this young lady...

876
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:11,244
Eliza and Suzannah.

877
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:13,266
Well, you take Eliza
to look at the pigs.

878
00:48:14,454 --> 00:48:15,954
And, well, I can offer you a cup of tea

879
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:17,219
and a bit of cake, both of you.

880
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,477
That's very kind. Thank you.

881
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:27,500
So no sign, then, of Mr. Sowden?

882
00:48:28,217 --> 00:48:29,746
No, nothing.

883
00:48:29,771 --> 00:48:31,062
We're glad he's gone.

884
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:14,686
I'd take advice, obviously,

885
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:16,711
but as well as reopening Listerwick,

886
00:49:16,852 --> 00:49:20,025
I'd like to sink a new pit
here, above Conery Wood.

887
00:49:21,189 --> 00:49:22,236
What?

888
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:25,882
I've told you before,
it's a nasty business.

889
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:27,702
I wish you wouldn't...

890
00:49:27,727 --> 00:49:29,352
Hinscliffe has heard Rawson's men

891
00:49:29,377 --> 00:49:31,002
in my upper bed here,

892
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:33,286
which means they're
not just stealing coal;

893
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,310
they're stealing
significant amounts of coal.

894
00:49:35,394 --> 00:49:37,154
What am I supposed to
do, take it lying down,

895
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:38,655
let them take what
they want from my land

896
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:39,821
and not do anything?

897
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:41,657
Is it costed?

898
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,147
Just over £2,000.

899
00:49:44,172 --> 00:49:46,406
I believe I can get it to just under.

900
00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:51,895
I can't lend you more than £450.

901
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:54,993
Really?

902
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,842
And how will you get the rest?

903
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:01,646
Well, it's not impossible that...

904
00:50:05,497 --> 00:50:08,581
Miss Walker and I have become
very close, and if things...

905
00:50:14,894 --> 00:50:16,061
How would you feel

906
00:50:16,086 --> 00:50:18,170
if she were to move
in here with me as...

907
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,560
For Miss Lister.

908
00:50:19,585 --> 00:50:20,668
My companion?

909
00:50:20,693 --> 00:50:22,042
I'd be very happy for you.

910
00:50:23,399 --> 00:50:24,858
It's time you settled.

911
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:27,310
All right, thank you.

912
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:28,460
Well, then...

913
00:50:29,644 --> 00:50:31,885
it's not impossible that
she might be in a position

914
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:33,019
to lend me some money.

915
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:37,019
Ma'am, the servant from
Crow Nest just called

916
00:50:37,044 --> 00:50:38,376
with this for you.

917
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:49,186
Thank you.

918
00:51:07,633 --> 00:51:08,666
My love,

919
00:51:09,644 --> 00:51:12,016
I find it impossible
to make up my own mind.

920
00:51:12,808 --> 00:51:14,149
I promised you an answer,

921
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,958
and I'm at your mercy.

922
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:20,119
I have written the words "yes" and "no"

923
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:22,868
on a slip of paper and
put them in a purse.

924
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:25,991
If you still think it
better to decide today,

925
00:51:26,602 --> 00:51:29,209
the paper you draw out
first must be the answer.

926
00:51:30,477 --> 00:51:32,084
Whatever shall be the event,

927
00:51:32,811 --> 00:51:35,805
I shall always remain your
faithful and affectionate

928
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,103
- Ann Walker.
- _

929
00:52:33,722 --> 00:52:35,365
I would have known what
to do with a yes or a no,

930
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:36,465
but this?

931
00:52:36,894 --> 00:52:38,477
What am I supposed to do with this?

932
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,079
I mean, do you think,
do you really think

933
00:52:40,103 --> 00:52:42,352
that I'm someone to
have my future happiness

934
00:52:42,377 --> 00:52:43,461
decided by fate,

935
00:52:43,486 --> 00:52:46,036
by which bit of paper
comes out of a purse first,

936
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:48,019
like a... like a raffle ticket?

937
00:52:48,103 --> 00:52:49,831
- No.
- What?

938
00:52:50,766 --> 00:52:52,892
No. I... I couldn't...

939
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:54,214
What?

940
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,560
- Ann!
- Nothing.

941
00:52:58,308 --> 00:52:59,838
I'm taking it as a no.

942
00:53:00,665 --> 00:53:01,665
It isn't a no.

943
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:03,023
Well, it isn't a yes.

944
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:05,292
Will you accept him?

945
00:53:05,852 --> 00:53:07,686
I don't want to, but...

946
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,899
But?

947
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:10,055
But what?

948
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:12,031
What?

949
00:53:13,344 --> 00:53:14,358
If I did,

950
00:53:15,602 --> 00:53:17,600
it would be out of duty.

951
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:18,792
Duty?

952
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:21,202
What, to her? To Mrs. Ainsworth?

953
00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:23,294
No.

954
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:24,527
Well, what, then?

955
00:53:24,936 --> 00:53:27,144
I...

956
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:47,096
Ann.

957
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:52,586
Ann, talk to me. We're adults.

958
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:55,138
Nothing can be this bad.

959
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:56,667
I'll never see you again.

960
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:57,796
What? What do you mean?

961
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:59,297
If I tell you the truth, you won't want

962
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:01,446
anything to do with me.

963
00:54:11,644 --> 00:54:12,894
I might surprise you.

964
00:54:13,978 --> 00:54:15,003
Hmm?

965
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:17,244
It's him.

966
00:54:18,727 --> 00:54:21,186
Him? Him who?

967
00:54:22,605 --> 00:54:24,396
The Reverend Ainsworth.

968
00:54:24,854 --> 00:54:26,686
I've been...

969
00:54:28,852 --> 00:54:31,519
Indiscreet with him.

970
00:54:37,894 --> 00:54:40,269
He said that he was in love with me,

971
00:54:40,352 --> 00:54:43,185
and that he wanted to marry
me and she wouldn't live long,

972
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,268
and I didn't want to,

973
00:54:44,293 --> 00:54:46,235
but I didn't know how to say no.

974
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:48,827
That's why I was so upset

975
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:49,995
when I heard that she'd died,

976
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:51,204
because I knew this would happen!

977
00:54:51,228 --> 00:54:52,727
I knew it wouldn't be five minutes

978
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:55,002
until he was writing to me, and, Anne,

979
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:58,482
Anne, I never encouraged him.

980
00:54:58,507 --> 00:55:01,089
I told him I didn't want
to, but then he just...

981
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:04,327
managed situations that
he was alone with me,

982
00:55:04,352 --> 00:55:05,952
either here when they visited

983
00:55:05,977 --> 00:55:07,932
or there at their house.

984
00:55:07,957 --> 00:55:09,291
Do...

985
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:11,589
do you understand?

986
00:55:11,614 --> 00:55:13,206
You understand the problem?

987
00:55:14,933 --> 00:55:16,041
He's had...

988
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:22,522
Intimate knowledge of me.

989
00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:43,135
Intimate how?

990
00:55:46,864 --> 00:55:48,490
Kissing?

991
00:55:54,612 --> 00:55:55,782
Did he...

992
00:55:56,907 --> 00:55:58,364
Touching?

993
00:56:10,644 --> 00:56:12,269
Have you been connected?

994
00:56:15,954 --> 00:56:17,020
Once.

995
00:56:22,686 --> 00:56:24,261
This is the thing.

996
00:56:25,011 --> 00:56:26,220
Does that not...

997
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:29,852
put me under an obligation to him,

998
00:56:29,877 --> 00:56:31,119
to Mr. Ainsworth?

999
00:56:31,144 --> 00:56:32,202
Hang on.

1000
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,171
He inflicted himself on you.

1001
00:56:39,558 --> 00:56:41,142
You were in his house

1002
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:43,785
to visit your friend, his wife.

1003
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:46,879
You were under his protection,

1004
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:49,452
in his house,

1005
00:56:51,435 --> 00:56:53,027
and he took advantage of you.

1006
00:56:53,052 --> 00:56:54,677
When she left the room.

1007
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:57,519
But still, does...
morally, does that not...

1008
00:56:57,544 --> 00:56:59,628
No, God. Good God, no!
Of course it doesn't.

1009
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:00,912
You're under no obligation at all

1010
00:57:00,936 --> 00:57:02,536
because he was married,
for heaven's sake!

1011
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,811
You're shouting. You're cross.

1012
00:57:03,836 --> 00:57:05,963
No, I'm not shouting at you.
I'm not cross at you.

1013
00:57:06,978 --> 00:57:09,983
I'm glad... I'm glad
you've told me, Ann.

1014
00:57:10,644 --> 00:57:14,811
Ann, you are not obligated to him.

1015
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,936
And do you see? Do you...

1016
00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:20,519
do you see now this is why
I couldn't say yes to you,

1017
00:57:20,544 --> 00:57:22,502
because I was worried that...

1018
00:57:22,703 --> 00:57:25,494
all sorts... that you'd be c... cross...

1019
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:26,869
- No.
- And that you'd expose me,

1020
00:57:26,894 --> 00:57:29,560
and that I wasn't even free
or fit to say yes to you,

1021
00:57:29,585 --> 00:57:31,585
and that's why I couldn't
show you the letter,

1022
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:33,318
and it's...

1023
00:57:33,577 --> 00:57:35,535
The letter's right here.

1024
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,560
And it's just clear
from the language he uses

1025
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:40,002
he already thinks I'm his.

1026
00:57:40,027 --> 00:57:41,230
To "My own little Annie,"

1027
00:57:41,255 --> 00:57:42,495
from "Your own Thomas Ainsworth,"

1028
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:43,869
and I couldn't tell anybody

1029
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:45,228
because he said it would reflect

1030
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,550
just as badly on me as it did on him.

1031
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,601
I know you'll think I'm weak...

1032
00:58:02,943 --> 00:58:04,368
and stupid...

1033
00:58:06,828 --> 00:58:09,953
but you see, if I'd had
someone like you in my life,

1034
00:58:09,978 --> 00:58:11,495
this would've never happened,

1035
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,270
because I'd have had someone to talk to,

1036
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,771
to tell...

1037
00:58:19,894 --> 00:58:22,560
someone who would've helped me.

1038
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:45,797
Is everything you've
told me absolutely true?

1039
00:58:47,061 --> 00:58:48,133
Yes.

1040
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:00,536
You do know I would have got you

1041
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,166
out of this scrape, don't you,

1042
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:05,471
whether you'd have
said yes to me or not?

1043
00:59:07,769 --> 00:59:08,894
Would you?

1044
00:59:12,061 --> 00:59:13,642
Grubby little wretch.

1045
00:59:15,394 --> 00:59:17,269
And in a dog collar.

1046
00:59:17,352 --> 00:59:20,727
He'll still be coming
over for this position,

1047
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:23,560
this meeting with the church trustees.

1048
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:25,686
The whole thing, no
doubt, is just a ruse

1049
00:59:25,711 --> 00:59:26,869
to get nearer to me.

1050
00:59:26,894 --> 00:59:28,127
Shh, shh, shh.

1051
00:59:32,016 --> 00:59:34,150
You have nothing more to fear from him.

1052
00:59:35,686 --> 00:59:37,119
Do you understand me?

1053
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:40,306
What are you going to do to him?

1054
00:59:46,402 --> 00:59:47,959
I haven't decided yet.

1055
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,167
The Reverend Thomas
Ainsworth is at the door.

1056
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,806
You don't think he
intends to propose to you?

1057
01:00:33,852 --> 01:00:36,352
So you shouldn't say
anything to Mr. Ainsworth.

1058
01:00:36,377 --> 01:00:38,661
Miss Lister! The thing
you should understand...

1059
01:00:38,686 --> 01:00:40,997
What you need to understand
is you would be exposed...

1060
01:00:41,022 --> 01:00:42,458
as an adulterer.

1061
01:00:42,483 --> 01:00:44,867
If she wants to start
running with the big dogs,

1062
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:46,410
then she's gonna have to
find out what it's like

1063
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,018
when they really start biting.

1064
01:00:48,542 --> 01:00:50,375
You're in the worst kind of danger,

1065
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,140
in this world and the next.

1066
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:54,977
I would rather
die then people know what we do.

1067
01:00:55,002 --> 01:00:56,501
It's wrong! It's repugnant!

1068
01:00:57,092 --> 01:00:59,134
You understand nothing about me.

1069
